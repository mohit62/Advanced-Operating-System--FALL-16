Implementation:

fs.h - Contains all the prototypes of the structures and functions being used in the implementation.
bs.c- Contains basic block read and write functionality implementation for the file system.
fs.c - Contains code for implementing generic operations in a basic File System as given below:
	a)fs_create-This function will create  a new file and defines the attributes of file like name etc.
	b)fs_open-This function will open the file with the filename passed as parameter.
	c)fs_write-This function will write the data  block from buffer to a file.
   	d)fs_read-This function will read the data block upto size passed as parameter.
	e)fs_close-This function will change the file already open to closed state.
	f)fs_seek-This function will move the pointer to the begining of data block.

Lessons Learned :
We learned about the basic concept of file system and inodes and various generic operations that can be performed in a File System.
