Q.   Does your program output any garbage? If yes, why? 

Sol. Yes,the program does show unexpected behaviour which can be termed as a garbage output during execution .E.g. " Producedxsh $  value 57" ,"ProdCuced value 113","nsumed value 57" etc.
This is because both producer and consumer processes are not synchronized.

Q.   Are all the produced values getting consumed? Check your program for a small count like 20.

Sol. No, all the produced values are not getting consumed.Even for a small countlike 20 , all the values are not getting consumed.

Functions used in the project:

-void consumer(int count)
-void producer(int count)
-shellcmd xsh_prodcons(int nargs, char *args[])
